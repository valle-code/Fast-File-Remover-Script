# Fast File Remover Script
A little Python script which safely deletes every file within a specified directory.

## Clone Repository
<pre> git clone https://github.com/valle-code/Fast-File-Remover-Script </pre>

## How to use 
You will be asked for an absolute path. When written you will be asked to confirm the path by typing "y" (THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS SO PLEASE READ WELL BEFORE CONFIRMING AS YOU CAN DELETE A DIRECTORY THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DELETE). If so, every file within that directoty will be instantly deleted, except for folders that aren't empty, as you will be asked for permission to delete them ("y" will delete and everything else won't)
